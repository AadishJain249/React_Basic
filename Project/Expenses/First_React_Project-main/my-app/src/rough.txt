  // componets are resuabe bit of code and work same as js functions and return html
      // in normal javascript we have to write code like this 
      // const para=document.createElement('p')
      // para.textContent='this is also visisble'
      // document.getElementById(root).append(para);


// componet must have uppercase character because in jsx (js allow html code to be written in it) lowervase 
// character is for html tags
// component->html,css,js->react

// we are using expenseitem in app and in expenseitem we are using expense date
// this is how component tree is built
